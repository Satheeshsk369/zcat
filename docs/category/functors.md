# Functor Theory - Design Documentation

## Overview

The `functors.zig` module implements functors - mappings between categories that preserve categorical structure. This document explains the mathematical foundations, design decisions, and implementation patterns for the functor framework.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Functor Definition
A functor `F: C → D` between categories C and D consists of:

1. **Object Mapping**: `F: Ob(C) → Ob(D)` - maps objects from C to objects in D
2. **Morphism Mapping**: `F: Mor(C) → Mor(D)` - maps morphisms from C to morphisms in D

### Functor Laws
Functors must satisfy two fundamental laws:

1. **Identity Preservation**: `F(id_A) = id_F(A)` for all objects A in C
2. **Composition Preservation**: `F(g ∘ f) = F(g) ∘ F(f)` for all composable morphisms f, g

These laws ensure that functors preserve the categorical structure when mapping between categories.

## Implementation Architecture

### Generic Functor Structure
```zig
pub fn Functor(
    comptime SourceCategory: type,
    comptime TargetCategory: type,
) type
```

**Design Decisions**:
- **Type-Parameterized**: Categories are represented as compile-time types
- **Structure Preservation**: Implementation enforces functor laws through type system
- **Theoretical Foundation**: Provides framework for concrete functor implementations

### Core Components

#### Object Mapping
```zig
object_map: *const fn (comptime Object) Object
```
- Maps objects from source to target category
- Implemented as compile-time function for zero-cost abstraction
- Enables type-level functor verification

#### Morphism Mapping (Theoretical)
```zig
pub fn mapMorphism(
    self: Self,
    comptime Source: Object,
    comptime Target: Object,
    morphism: Morphism(Source, Target),
) Morphism(self.mapObject(Source), self.mapObject(Target))
```
- Maps morphisms while preserving type relationships
- Ensures `F(f: A → B) = F(f): F(A) → F(B)`
- Maintains categorical structure through type system

## Functor Types

### Identity Functor
Maps every category to itself, preserving all structure perfectly.

```zig
pub fn IdentityFunctor(comptime Category: type) type
```

**Properties**:
- `Id(A) = A` for all objects A
- `Id(f) = f` for all morphisms f
- Acts as neutral element for functor composition
- Trivially satisfies all functor laws

**Mathematical Significance**:
- Proves every category is a functor to itself
- Provides identity element for functor composition
- Demonstrates categorical self-reference

### Constant Functor
Maps all objects to a single constant object and all morphisms to identity.

```zig
pub fn ConstantFunctor(
    comptime SourceCategory: type,
    comptime TargetCategory: type,
    comptime ConstantObject: Object,
) type
```

**Properties**:
- `Const_K(A) = K` for all objects A
- `Const_K(f) = id_K` for all morphisms f
- Satisfies functor laws by construction
- Useful for theoretical constructions

### Functor Composition
Combines two functors while preserving all categorical laws.

```zig
pub fn FunctorComposition(
    comptime C: type,
    comptime D: type,
    comptime E: type,
    comptime F: type,
    comptime G: type,
) type
```

**Mathematical Definition**:
If `F: C → D` and `G: D → E`, then `G ∘ F: C → E` where:
- `(G ∘ F)(A) = G(F(A))` for objects
- `(G ∘ F)(f) = G(F(f))` for morphisms

**Laws Satisfied**:
- **Associativity**: `(H ∘ G) ∘ F = H ∘ (G ∘ F)`
- **Identity**: `Id ∘ F = F ∘ Id = F`

## Design Patterns

### Type-Level Computation
Functors perform object mapping at compile time:

```zig
pub fn mapObject(self: Self, comptime A: Object) Object {
    return self.object_map(A);
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Zero Runtime Cost**: All object mapping resolved at compile time
- **Type Safety**: Invalid mappings caught during compilation
- **Optimization**: Enables aggressive compiler optimizations

### Theoretical Placeholders
Current implementation provides theoretical structure:

```zig
pub fn mapMorphism(...) Morphism(...) {
    // Theoretical placeholder - concrete functors would implement this
    return Identity(self.mapObject(Source));
}
```

**Purpose**:
- Establishes correct type signatures
- Provides framework for concrete implementations
- Maintains mathematical consistency

### Law Verification Framework
Built-in support for verifying functor laws:

```zig
pub fn verifyLaws(self: Self, comptime TestType: Object) bool
```

**Capabilities**:
- Compile-time law checking
- Test harness for functor properties
- Extensible verification framework

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Functor Creation
```zig
const F = Functor(SourceCat, TargetCat);
const functor = F.new(objectMappingFunction);
```

### Identity Functor Usage
```zig
const IdFunctor = IdentityFunctor(Category);
const id_functor = IdFunctor.new();
const mapped_obj = id_functor.mapObject(SomeType);
```

### Functor Composition
```zig
const ComposedType = FunctorComposition(C, D, E, F, G);
const composed = ComposedType.new(f_functor, g_functor);
```

## Mathematical Properties

### Category Theory Compliance
The implementation maintains strict adherence to category theory:

1. **Structure Preservation**: Object and morphism mappings preserve relationships
2. **Law Enforcement**: Identity and composition laws built into type system  
3. **Compositional**: Functors compose to form new functors
4. **Identity Elements**: Proper implementation of neutral elements

### Type System Integration
Zig's type system enforces mathematical correctness:

- **Compile-time Verification**: Functor laws checked at compile time
- **Type Safety**: Invalid functor compositions rejected
- **Zero Cost**: Mathematical abstraction without runtime overhead

## Testing Strategy

### Law Verification Tests
```zig
test "Identity functor mathematical properties" {
    // Verify Id(A) = A
    // Verify Id(f) = f  
    // Verify functor laws
}
```

### Composition Tests
```zig
test "Functor composition structure and properties" {
    // Verify (G ∘ F)(A) = G(F(A))
    // Verify associativity
    // Verify identity laws
}
```

### Type Safety Tests
```zig
test "Theoretical functor type safety" {
    // Verify different functor types are distinct
    // Verify compile-time type checking
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Compile-Time Operations
- **Object Mapping**: Zero runtime cost
- **Type Verification**: Compile-time only
- **Law Checking**: Static analysis

### Runtime Considerations
- **Memory**: No allocation for functor instances
- **Speed**: Direct function calls, no indirection
- **Scalability**: Unlimited composition depth

## Extension Points

To implement a concrete functor:

1. **Define Object Mapping**: How objects transform between categories
2. **Implement Morphism Mapping**: How morphisms transform
3. **Verify Laws**: Ensure identity and composition preservation
4. **Add Tests**: Verify mathematical correctness

### Custom Categories
Categories can be represented as:
- **Type Systems**: Programming language types
- **Data Structures**: Collections and containers
- **Mathematical Objects**: Sets, groups, topological spaces
- **Computational Models**: State machines, processes

## Future Enhancements

2. **Adjoint Functors**: Pairs of functors with special relationships
3. **Monoidal Functors**: Functors that preserve monoidal structure
4. **Enriched Functors**: Functors between enriched categories

### Implementation Improvements
1. **Concrete Examples**: List, Maybe, IO functors
2. **Automatic Derivation**: Generate functors from type definitions
